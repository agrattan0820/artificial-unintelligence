## Dev Tutorial

1. Configure your environment variables (`.env` for the server folder and `.env.local` for the client folder):

   1. Server:
      1. `PORT` - port the http server runs on
      2. `DATABASE_URL` - connection string to your PostgreSQL database
      3. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - authorization key for the OpenAI API
   1. Client:
      1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - URL to the running API (ex. <http://localhost:8080>)
      2. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - authorization key for the OpenAI API

2. Install the packages in both the client and server directories:

   ```bash
   # Run in both client and server
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development instances of both the client and server:

   ```bash
   # Run in both client and server
   yarn dev
   ```

4. This opens the client on <http://localhost:3000> and the server on <http://localhost:8080>, navigate to these links to see your code changes in real-time.
