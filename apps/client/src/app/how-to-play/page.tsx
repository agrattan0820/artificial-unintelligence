          <p>
            Artificial Unintelligence is an online multiplayer game where
            players compete against each other to create the funniest
            AI-generated images in response to amusing prompts.

          Some prompts you might encounter:
          <ul>
            <li>A canceled children&apos;s toy</li>
            <li>The creature hidden in IKEA</li>
            <li>The newly discovered animal in Australia</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The game is inspired by party games like{" "}

            If you&apos;ve ever played the game, &quot;Quiplash&quot; from
            Jackbox Party Pack, you can think of Artificial Unintelligence as
            the same game but rather than answering with text, you answer with
            images!

          <p>
            Starting a game of Artificial Unintelligence will create a room with
            a unique room code and an invite link to join the room. The player
            who starts the game and creates the room is also known as the
            room&apos;s &quot;host.&quot;
          </p>
          <ImageFigure
            image={{
              src: Lobby,
              alt: "Artificial Unintelligence lobby and invite link",
            }}
            caption="The room lobby where players meet before starting a game."
          />
          <p>
            The host can share the unique invite link with other prospective
            players to have them join their room.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            To share the invite link: press the &quot;Invite Players&quot;
            button to copy the link to your clipboard or open the share menu,
            depending on which device you are playing on.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Once at least 3 players are in the room (max of 8 players), the game
            is allowed to begin, initiated by the host of the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            A game consists of three rounds, and each round is split into two
            phases:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Generation</li>
            <li>Face-Off</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="generation">Generation Phase</h2>
          <p>
            During the &quot;Generation&quot; phase, each player will be given
            two prompts. These prompts will be the basis for the AI-generated
            images the players create. Each of the two prompts a player receives
            is shared with another player in the game. Once all players create
            and submit images for their two assigned prompts, the game
            transitions to the <a href="#faceOff">&quot;Face-Off&quot;</a> phase
            where the image generations compete against whichever counterpart
            shared the same original prompt.
          </p>
          <ImageFigure
            image={{
              src: Prompt,

            }}
            caption="The entered text is transformed into an image."
          />
          <p>
            To generate an image, describe an interesting picture within the
            provided text input and press the submit button. After a few
            seconds, two images based on your description will appear. You can
            decide to either submit one of these images as a response to the
            prompt or generate a new set of two images with a new description.
            You can generate a maximum of 3 extra sets of images per question,
            so make them count!
          </p>
          <ImageFigure

          <blockquote>
            To submit an image, click or tap on the image you want to appear in
            the face-off and then press the submit button.
          </blockquote>
          <h2 id="faceOff">Face-Off Phase</h2>
          <p>
            The &quot;Face-Off&quot; phase showcases all of the player-submitted
            images in 1v1 duels where all players excluding those who have an
            image in the duel vote on which one is the funniest.
          </p>
          <ImageFigure
            image={{
              src: Voting,

            caption="Players outside of the ones who generated the images vote."
          />
          <blockquote>
            To vote on an image, click or tap on the image and then press the
            &quot;Confirm Vote&quot; button.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Once all votes have been tallied for a duel, the winner and the
            original prompts the players used to generate the images are
            revealed.
          </p>
          <ImageFigure
            image={{
              src: VotingResults,

            caption="The winning image is highlighted while all of the original prompts are shown."
          />
          <p>
            For each 1% of the votes a player&apos;s image receives in the duel,
            they will receive 10 points (e.g. if an image receives 50% of the
            votes, 500 points will be awarded to the player who submitted the
            image).
          </p>
          <p>
            Once all duels have been completed for the round, the game will
            return to the <a href="#generation">&quot;Generation&quot;</a> phase
            until a total of 3 rounds have been completed.
          </p>
          <h2>Scoring and Winning the Game</h2>
          <p>
            Once 3 rounds have been completed, all points are tallied up from
            the votes the players garnered and the player with the most points
            at the end wins the game.
